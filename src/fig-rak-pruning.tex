  \caption{Illustration of vertex pruning optimization: Once vertex $1$ is processed, it is unmarked. If vertex $1$ changes its community, its neighbors are marked for processing. Community membership of each vertex is indicated by border color, and marked vertices are highlighted in yellow \cite{sahu2023gvelouvain}.}
