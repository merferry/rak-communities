In conclusion, this study addresses the optimization of LPA, a high-quality community detection algorithm, in the shared memory setting. We consider 9 different optimizations, which significantly improve the performance of the local-moving and the aggregation phases of the algorithm. On a server with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, comparison with competitive open source implementations (Vite and Grappolo) and packages (NetworKit) show that our optimized implementation of LPA, which we term as GVE-LPA, is on average $50\times$, $22\times$, and $20\times$ faster than Vite, Grappolo, and NetworKit respectively. In addition, GVE-LPA on average obtains $3.1\%$ higher modularity than Vite\ignore{(especially on web graph)}, and $0.6\%$ lower modularity than Grappolo and NetworKit\ignore{(especially on social networks with poor clustering)}. On a web graph with $3.8$ billion edges, GVE-LPA identifies communities in $6.8$ seconds, and thus achieves a processing rate of $560$ million edges/s. In addition, GVE-LPA achieves a strong scaling factor of $1.6\times$ for every doubling of threads. Looking ahead, future work could focus of designing dynamic algorithms for LPA to accommodate dynamic graphs which evolve over time. This would contribute to interactive updation of community memberships of vertices in real-world scenarios.
